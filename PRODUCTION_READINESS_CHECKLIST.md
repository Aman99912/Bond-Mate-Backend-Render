- **Memory Usage**: < 500MB under normal load
- **Concurrent Users**: 1000+ supported

### Load Testing Commands
```bash
# Test partner request creation
ab -n 1000 -c 10 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" \
  -p request.json -T "application/json" \
  https://your-domain.com/api/enhanced-partners/request

# Test rate limiting
ab -n 100 -c 10 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" \
  https://your-domain.com/api/enhanced-partners/requests
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Hardening

## üìà Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Partner Requests**: Rate, success/failure ratio
- **Database Performance**: Query times, connection pool
- **Memory Usage**: Heap usage, garbage collection
- **Security Events**: Failed auths, rate limit hits
- **Notification Delivery**: Success rate, retry attempts
- **Background Workers**: Task completion, errors

### Alert Thresholds
- **Memory Usage**: > 80% of available memory
- **Database Response**: > 1 second average
- **Error Rate**: > 5% of requests
- **Security Violations**: > 10 per hour
- **Failed Notifications**: > 20% failure rate

## üéØ Success Criteria

3. **Monitor Metrics**: Use `/api/monitoring/metrics`
4. **Database Status**: Verify MongoDB connection
5. **Restart Services**: If necessary, restart application
6. **Escalate**: Contact development team if issues persist

### Rollback Plan
1. **Stop Application**: Graceful shutdown
2. **Revert Code**: Deploy previous stable version
3. **Database Rollback**: If data corruption occurred
4. **Verify Functionality**: Test critical endpoints
5. **Monitor**: Watch for stability
